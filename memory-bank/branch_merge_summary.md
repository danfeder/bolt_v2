# Branch Merge Summary - March 2, 2025

## Merge Process Completed

Today we completed a systematic merge of two feature branches into the main branch:

1. **Performance Testing Framework Branch**
   - Branch: `feature/performance-testing-framework`
   - Features: Comprehensive performance testing framework for genetic algorithm scheduler
   - Major components:
     - Performance tracking utilities
     - Comprehensive benchmarks
     - Performance regression testing
     - Supporting tools (CLI runners, baseline management)

2. **Genetic Algorithm Experiment Framework Branch**
   - Branch: `feature/genetic-algorithm-experiment-framework`
   - Features: Experiment framework for tuning and analyzing genetic algorithm parameters
   - Major components:
     - Parameter tuning system
     - Statistics tracking
     - Experiment management with grid search
     - Visualization tools
     - Demo scripts

## Merge Steps Executed

1. Committed and pushed frontend enhancement plan changes to performance testing branch
2. Merged performance testing branch into main
3. Updated genetic algorithm experiment branch with main changes (resolved conflicts)
4. Merged genetic algorithm experiment branch into main
5. Created new branch for frontend enhancement implementation

## Current Status

- **Main Branch**: Contains both performance testing framework and genetic algorithm experiment framework
- **Active Development Branch**: `feature/frontend-enhancement-implementation`
- **Remaining Active Branch**: `feature/app-stability-testing`

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Enhancement Implementation**
   - Follow the plan in `frontend_user_testing_plan.md`
   - Implement React 18 and TypeScript improvements
   - Enhance UI components
   - Integrate advanced solver controls
   - Implement user feedback mechanisms

2. **User Testing Framework Setup**
   - Form test groups with diverse user personas
   - Set up testing infrastructure
   - Create structured test plan
   - Implement analysis framework

3. **Future Integration**
   - Eventually evaluate and merge the app stability testing branch
   - Plan integration of frontend enhancements with stability improvements

## Notes

- The merge process was completed with minimal conflicts
- Primary conflict was in the progress.md file, which was manually resolved
- All features have been successfully integrated and appear to be functioning properly
