# Project Brief: Gym Class Rotation Scheduler

## Overview
A sophisticated web application designed to automate the scheduling of gym classes in a school environment. The system creates optimal rotation schedules while respecting various constraints and preferences.

## Core Requirements

### Schedule Generation
- Generate conflict-free class schedules
- Support for multiple periods per day (1-8)
- Handle weekly recurring patterns
- Respect teacher availability
- Enforce maximum classes per day/week
- Handle consecutive class constraints

### Data Management
- Import class and availability data
- Edit class information
- Manage teacher availability
- Configure scheduling constraints

### User Interface
- Interactive calendar view
- Class editor interface
- Teacher availability management
- Constraint configuration
- Debug/testing capabilities

## Technical Goals
1. Maintain scheduling algorithm efficiency
2. Ensure responsive user interface
3. Provide clear error feedback
4. Support data import/export
5. Enable schedule visualization

## Success Criteria
- Generate valid schedules meeting all constraints
- Provide intuitive interface for data input
- Clear visualization of generated schedules
- Helpful error messages for constraint violations
- Support for testing and debugging
