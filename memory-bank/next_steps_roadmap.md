# Next Steps Roadmap

This document outlines the detailed plan for the next phase of development on the scheduler project, with priorities and specific tasks for each area.

## 1. Application Stability & Environment Setup

**Priority: Highest**  
**Estimated Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

The primary focus should be ensuring the application is stable, testable, and properly integrated. This lays the foundation for all future work.

### Tasks:

1. **Fix Integration Tests**
   - Resolve the `httpx` and other dependency issues
   - Fix the syntax error in `main.py`
   - Ensure all imports are correctly defined across modules
   - Get test coverage to at least 75% for critical paths

2. **Environment Standardization**
   - Document the correct virtual environment setup
   - Create a container-based development environment
   - Add dependency management automation
   - Ensure consistent behavior across development and testing

3. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add structured error handling throughout the application
   - Implement proper logging for all critical components
   - Add graceful failures for solver timeouts
   - Create user-friendly error messages for API endpoints

## 2. Frontend Dashboard Integration

**Priority: High**  
**Estimated Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

Now that the backend dashboard API is complete, the next step is to create the frontend visualization components.

### Tasks:

1. **Chart Component Development**
   - Select and implement an appropriate charting library
   - Create components for each chart type:
     - Daily distribution bar chart
     - Period distribution bar chart
     - Grade distribution bar chart
     - Grade-period heatmap
   - Add interactivity for filtering and exploring data

2. **Dashboard Layout**
   - Design a responsive dashboard layout
   - Include all visualization components
   - Add tabs for different analysis views
   - Create comparison view for A/B testing schedules

3. **API Integration**
   - Connect to all dashboard API endpoints
   - Add data fetching and caching
   - Implement error handling for API failures
   - Add loading states for asynchronous operations

## 3. Genetic Algorithm Refinement

**Priority: Medium**  
**Estimated Timeline: 3-4 weeks**

Improve the genetic algorithm's performance and capabilities to generate better schedules more efficiently.

### Tasks:

1. **Experiment Framework**
   - Create a parameter tuning framework for GA settings
   - Build automated testing for different parameter combinations
   - Implement metrics collection for experiment results
   - Add visualization for parameter impact on results

2. **Population Visualization**
   - Add tools to visualize population diversity
   - Create fitness landscape visualization
   - Track population evolution over generations
   - Implement chromosome visualization

3. **Hybrid Algorithm Development**
   - Combine genetic algorithm with local search
   - Implement hill climbing for chromosome refinement
   - Add adaptive mutation operators
   - Create intelligent crossover methods

## 4. Performance Optimizations

**Priority: Medium**  
**Estimated Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

Implement performance improvements to handle larger datasets and more complex constraints.

### Tasks:

1. **Checkpointing System**
   - Create serialization for solver state
   - Implement periodic checkpointing
   - Add checkpoint restoration capability
   - Build API endpoints for checkpoint management

2. **Parallel Processing Improvements**
   - Implement island model for population isolation
   - Add migration between sub-populations
   - Optimize parallel fitness evaluation
   - Implement thread-safe operations

3. **Solution Quality Enhancements**
   - Create specialized repair operators
   - Implement constraint-aware mutation
   - Add memoization for fitness evaluation
   - Develop intelligent initialization strategies

## 5. Future Considerations

**Priority: Low**  
**Estimated Timeline: Future Releases**

These items are important but can be addressed in future development cycles after the higher priorities are completed.

1. **Development Solver Improvements**
   - Experiment with different search heuristics
   - Fine-tune objective weights
   - Create automated solver parameter optimization
   - Add comprehensive solver benchmarking

2. **Extended Quality Metrics**
   - Develop trend analysis for schedule improvements
   - Create predictive models for schedule quality
   - Implement recommendation engine for constraint adjustments
   - Add advanced reporting capabilities

3. **Seasonal Adaptations** (Deferred Feature)
   - Design seasonal profile configuration
   - Implement constraint variations by season
   - Add season-specific facility availability
   - Create transition handling between seasons

## Implementation Approach

We recommend an iterative approach, focusing first on application stability, then frontend integration, followed by algorithm refinement and performance optimization. This ensures that:

1. We have a stable foundation that supports future development
2. Users can immediately benefit from the dashboard visualization
3. Performance improvements build on a reliable codebase
4. Advanced features are added to a mature application

Each phase should include proper testing, documentation updates, and stakeholder reviews to ensure alignment with project goals.
