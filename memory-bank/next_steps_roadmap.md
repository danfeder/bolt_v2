   - ✅ Fixed genetic optimizer test functionality with simplified test approach
   - Get test coverage to at least 75% for critical paths (currently at 69%)
     - Genetic algorithm components now at high coverage:
       - chromosome.py: 89% coverage
       - fitness.py: 100% coverage  
       - population.py: 93% coverage
       - adaptation.py: 95% coverage

## Implementation Approach

We recommend an iterative approach, focusing first on application stability, then frontend integration, followed by algorithm refinement and performance optimization. This ensures that:

1. We have a stable foundation that supports future development
2. Users can immediately benefit from the dashboard visualization
3. Performance improvements build on a reliable codebase
4. Advanced features are added to a mature application

Each phase should include proper testing, documentation updates, and stakeholder reviews to ensure alignment with project goals.
