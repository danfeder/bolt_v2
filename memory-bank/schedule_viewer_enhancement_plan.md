# Schedule Viewer Enhancement Plan

## Overview
The Schedule Viewer component (currently implemented as `Calendar.tsx`) needs enhancements to improve usability, visual presentation, and functionality. This document outlines the plan for upgrading this critical component.

## Current Limitations
- Basic tabular calendar view with limited filtering options
- No class conflict visualization or highlighting
- No ability to switch between different view modes
- Limited information about each class assignment
- No filtering or sorting capabilities
- No export functionality
- Lacks responsive design optimizations for mobile

## Enhancement Goals
1. Create a modern, responsive Schedule Viewer with multiple view options
2. Improve visual indication of conflicts and constraints
3. Add robust filtering and sorting capabilities
4. Implement export functionality
5. Enhance class details and information display
6. Improve navigation and user interaction
7. Add accessibility features

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Component Restructuring
- Rename component from `Calendar.tsx` to `ScheduleViewer.tsx`
- Break down into smaller, focused sub-components:
  - `ScheduleHeader`: Navigation controls, view selectors, and export options
  - `ScheduleCalendarView`: Enhanced version of the current calendar view
  - `ScheduleListView`: New alternative list-based view of assignments
  - `ScheduleFilterPanel`: Filtering and sorting controls
  - `ClassAssignmentCard`: Improved class assignment display
  - `ScheduleExportOptions`: Export functionality

### Phase 2: View Modes Implementation
1. **Calendar View (Enhanced)**
   - Improved weekly calendar layout
   - Color-coding for different grades or class types
   - Visual indicators for conflicts and constraint satisfaction
   - Tooltips with detailed class information
   - Quick actions for modifying assignments

2. **List View (New)**
   - Tabular view of all assignments
   - Sortable columns (by date, period, class name, grade)
   - Detailed information displayed in expandable rows
   - Bulk selection for export or modification

### Phase 3: Filtering and Sorting
- Filter options:
  - By date range
  - By period
  - By grade level
  - By class name (search)
  - By constraint status (conflicts, required periods)
- Sorting options:
  - Chronological (default)
  - Alphabetical by class name
  - By grade level
  - By constraint satisfaction status

### Phase 4: Export Functionality
- Export formats:
  - CSV for spreadsheet applications
  - PDF for printing
  - iCalendar format for calendar applications
- Export options:
  - Full schedule
  - Filtered view
  - Selected assignments only
  - Custom date range

### Phase 5: Accessibility and Responsive Design
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- High contrast mode option
- Text size adjustments

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Work (as of March 2, 2025)

#### Phase 1: Component Restructuring 
- Renamed component from `Calendar.tsx` to `ScheduleViewer.tsx`
- Broken down into focused sub-components:
  - `ScheduleHeader`: Navigation controls, view selectors implemented
  - `ScheduleCalendarView`: Enhanced calendar view with better layout
  - `ScheduleListView`: Alternative list-based view of assignments
  - `ScheduleFilterPanel`: Filtering and sorting controls
  - `ClassAssignmentCard`: Improved class assignment display

#### Phase 2: View Modes Implementation 
1. **Calendar View (Enhanced)** 
   - Improved weekly calendar layout
   - Color-coding for different grades and class types
   - Visual indicators for conflicts
   - Better period and day display

2. **List View (New)** 
   - Tabular view of all assignments
   - Sortable columns (by date, period, class name, grade)
   - Detailed information displayed in structured format

#### Phase 3: Filtering and Sorting 
- Filter options implemented:
  - By period
  - By grade level
  - By class name (search)
- Basic sorting implemented in list view

#### Testing Enhancements 
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new components:
  - Unit tests for each subcomponent
  - Integration tests for component interaction
  - Fixed TypeScript errors in test files
  - Improved test resilience and maintainability
  - Enhanced mocking strategy for Zustand store
  - All tests passing consistently

### Remaining Work

#### Phase 4: Export Functionality
- Export formats:
  - CSV for spreadsheet applications
  - PDF for printing
  - iCalendar format for calendar applications
- Export options:
  - Full schedule
  - Filtered view
  - Selected assignments only
  - Custom date range

#### Phase 5: Accessibility and Responsive Design
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- High contrast mode option
- Text size adjustments

## Technical Implementation Details
- Use TailwindCSS for styling
- Implement view state using React hooks
- Use modular component architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Leverage existing Zustand store for data management
- Add comprehensive tests for all new functionality
- Include detailed documentation for each component

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each subcomponent
2. Integration tests for component interaction
3. End-to-end testing for user workflows
4. Cross-browser and responsive design testing
5. Accessibility testing with screen readers

## Success Metrics
- 90%+ test coverage for new components
- Improved user feedback in testing sessions
- Successful integration with existing application flow
- Full responsive design support across devices
