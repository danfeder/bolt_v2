# Frontend Enhancement & User Testing Implementation Plan

*Created: March 2, 2025*

## Document Purpose

This document outlines a structured approach to enhance the existing frontend of the Gym Class Rotation Scheduler and implement a systematic user testing framework. It builds upon the work completed so far, including the recent performance testing framework and dashboard implementation.

## Integration with Existing Planning Documents

This plan enhances and extends the existing roadmap by:
1. Aligning with the iterative approach described in [next_steps_roadmap.md](../memory-bank/next_steps_roadmap.md)
2. Building upon the completed dashboard work documented in [dashboard_overview.md](../memory-bank/dashboard_overview.md)
3. Complementing the performance testing framework implemented on March 2, 2025
4. Extending the testing approach in [testingPlanFullDataset.md](../memory-bank/testingPlanFullDataset.md) to include user-focused testing
