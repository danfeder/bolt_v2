# Clean Up Generated Files

**Task ID**: I-01  
**Status**: Completed  
**Date**: March 2, 2025  
**Dependencies**: P-01 (Directory Reorganization Plan)

## 1. Summary

This document summarizes the actions taken to clean up generated files in the Gym Class Rotation Scheduler project as part of Task I-01. The cleanup was based on the recommendations from the Directory Structure Analysis (A-01) and Directory Reorganization Plan (P-01).

## 2. Actions Completed

### 2.1 Updated `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` file was enhanced to exclude the following:

- **Test Coverage Reports**:
  - `coverage/`
  - `scheduler-backend/coverage_report/`
  - `scheduler-backend/htmlcov/`
  - `reports/coverage/`
  - `.coverage`
  - `*.cover`

- **Python Generated Files**:
  - `__pycache__/`
  - `*.py[cod]`
  - `*$py.class`
  - `.pytest_cache/`
  - `.coverage.*`
  - `htmlcov/`
  - `pytest-report.xml`

- **Virtual Environments**:
  - `venv/`
  - `env/`
  - `ENV/`

- **Build Artifacts**:
  - `build/`
  - `dist/`
  - `*.egg-info/`
  - `*.egg`
  - `*.so`
  - `*.dylib`
  - `*.dll`

- **Node.js/React Build Artifacts**:
  - `.cache/`
  - `.parcel-cache/`

### 2.2 Relocated Coverage Reports

Coverage reports were moved to a centralized location:
- Created a dedicated `reports/` directory
- Moved frontend coverage from `coverage/` to `reports/coverage/frontend/`
- Moved backend coverage from `scheduler-backend/coverage_report/` to `reports/coverage/backend/`

### 2.3 Removed Redundant Files

The following redundant files were removed:
- `.DS_Store` files
- Any other temporary files found during the cleanup

### 2.4 Added Documentation

- Created `reports/README.md` to document the purpose and usage of the reports directory
- This document (`clean_up_generated_files.md`) to summarize the cleanup process

## 3. Verification

### 3.1 Build Verification

The following builds were verified to ensure our changes didn't break anything:
- Frontend build (using `npm run build`)
- Backend tests (using `python3 -m pytest`)

## 4. Future Recommendations

### 4.1 Short-term

- Set up a pre-commit hook to prevent committing generated files
- Add a clean script to package.json for easy cleanup of generated files

### 4.2 Long-term

- Automate the generation and storage of coverage reports in the CI/CD pipeline
- Implement a consistent approach for handling generated files across the project

## 5. Conclusion

The cleanup of generated files has improved the repository structure by:
- Preventing generated files from being committed to version control
- Centralizing coverage reports in a dedicated directory
- Providing clear documentation for handling generated files

These changes align with the broader directory reorganization plan and lay the groundwork for further implementation phase tasks.
