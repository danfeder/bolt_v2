# Code Quality Metrics Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the current code quality of the Gym Class Rotation Scheduler project, providing metrics on test coverage, component sizes, duplication, and documentation quality. This baseline will help identify areas for improvement during the refactoring process.

## Backend Code Metrics

### Size and Complexity
- Total Python files: 82
- Largest files by line count:
  1. `test_meta_optimizer.py` (1105 lines)
  2. `visualizations.py` (1025 lines)
  3. `dashboard.py` (741 lines)
  4. `main.py` (698 lines)
  5. `test_parallel.py` (691 lines)
  6. `test_genetic_optimizer_extended.py` (653 lines)
  7. `solver.py` (641 lines)
  8. `test_visualizations.py` (608 lines)
  9. `experiments/__init__.py` (557 lines)

### Test Coverage
- **Overall backend test coverage: 17%**
- Coverage by key module:
  - `app/models.py`: 94% (excellent)
  - `app/scheduling/solvers/genetic/visualizations.py`: 80% (good) 
  - `app/scheduling/solvers/genetic/chromosome.py`: 89% (good)
  - `app/scheduling/solvers/genetic/optimizer.py`: 100% (excellent)
  - `app/scheduling/solvers/genetic/fitness.py`: 100% (excellent)
  - `app/scheduling/solvers/genetic/parallel.py`: 93% (excellent)
  - `app/scheduling/solvers/genetic/adaptation.py`: 95% (excellent)
  - `app/scheduling/solvers/genetic/population.py`: 93% (excellent)
  - `app/scheduling/solvers/genetic/meta_optimizer.py`: 35% (poor)
  - `app/main.py`: 0% (critical)
  - `app/visualization/dashboard.py`: 0% (critical)
  - `app/scheduling/constraints/*`: 10-41% (poor)
  - `app/scheduling/objectives/*`: 22-71% (poor to moderate)

### Documentation Quality
- **Well-documented components**:
  - Genetic algorithm components (strong docstrings, parameter descriptions, and method explanations)
  - Core models (well-documented with field descriptions)
  
- **Poorly documented components**:
  - Constraints implementation (limited docstrings)
  - API routes (minimal documentation)
  - Helper functions (inconsistent documentation)

### Code Duplication
- Multiple model definitions detected:
  - 7 separate `models.py` files found in the codebase
  - Potential duplication of class definitions and validation logic 
  - Duplicate type definitions between frontend and backend

## Frontend Code Metrics

### Size and Complexity
- Largest frontend components by line count:
  1. `apiClient.ts` (409 lines)
  2. `ClassEditor.tsx` (397 lines)
  3. `FileUpload.tsx` (361 lines)
  4. `ScheduleDebugPanel.tsx` (292 lines)
  5. `FileUpload.test.tsx` (281 lines)
  6. `scheduleStore.ts` (269 lines)
  7. `ConstraintsForm.tsx` (207 lines)
  8. `ScheduleListView.tsx` (190 lines)
  9. `GradePeriodHeatmap.tsx` (186 lines)

### Test Coverage
- **Overall frontend test coverage: 82.47%**
- Statement coverage: 82.47% (80/97)
- Branch coverage: 70.73% (29/41)
- Function coverage: 78.94% (15/19)
- Line coverage: 82.1% (78/95)

### Component Quality
- Several components exceed 300 lines, suggesting opportunities for decomposition
- `ClassEditor.tsx` contains complex state management that could be refactored
- Some components like `FileUpload.tsx` mix presentation and business logic

## Summary of Findings

### Strengths
1. **Strong Genetic Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Excellent test coverage (89-100%)
   - Well-documented code with thorough docstrings
   - Clean separation of concerns with dedicated classes for different aspects of the algorithm

2. **Frontend Test Coverage**:
   - Good overall coverage (82.47%)
   - Component tests for key functionality

3. **Core Models**:
   - Well-defined data models with validation
   - Good documentation of fields and constraints

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Critical Test Coverage Gaps**:
   - Main application entry point (`app/main.py`) - 0% coverage
   - Dashboard visualization - 0% coverage
   - Constraints implementation - 10-15% coverage
   - Objectives implementation - 22-71% coverage

2. **Code Organization Issues**:
   - Multiple model definitions spread across the codebase
   - Large component files exceeding 300 lines
   - Mixed concerns in frontend components

3. **Documentation Inconsistencies**:
   - Excellent documentation in genetic algorithm but poor in constraints and API routes
   - Lack of high-level architecture documentation

## Recommendations
Based on these metrics, the following areas should be prioritized in the refactoring process:

1. **Increase Test Coverage**:
   - Target critical components with 0% coverage
   - Improve constraint and objective test coverage to at least 70%

2. **Reduce Component Size**:
   - Refactor large components (>300 lines) into smaller, focused components
   - Extract complex logic into dedicated services or hooks

3. **Eliminate Duplication**:
   - Consolidate model definitions
   - Consider code generation for shared types between frontend and backend

4. **Improve Documentation**:
   - Standardize documentation format across the codebase
   - Add high-level architecture documentation
   - Add documentation for constraint implementations
