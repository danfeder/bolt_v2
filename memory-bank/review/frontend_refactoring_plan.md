# Frontend Refactoring Plan

**Task ID**: P-04  
**Status**: Completed  
**Date**: March 2, 2025  
**Dependencies**: A-05 (Frontend Component Analysis)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for refactoring the frontend components of the Gym Class Rotation Scheduler project. Based on the Frontend Component Analysis (Task A-05), this plan addresses identified weaknesses in component structure, state management, UI/UX implementation, and testing. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and user experience while preserving core functionality.

## 2. Refactoring Goals and Approach

### 2.1 High-Level Refactoring Goals

1. **Improve Component Structure**: Break down large components and establish clear separation of concerns
2. **Enhance State Management**: Optimize store organization and implement better patterns for state synchronization
3. **Standardize UI/UX Patterns**: Create a consistent design system and improve accessibility
4. **Strengthen Testing**: Fill testing gaps and improve test organization
5. **Optimize Performance**: Implement strategic optimizations for better user experience

### 2.2 Refactoring Principles

The refactoring will adhere to the following principles:

1. **Component-Focused**: Focus on creating smaller, more focused components with single responsibilities
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement changes incrementally, ensuring continuous functionality
3. **Pattern Consistency**: Establish and follow consistent patterns across the codebase
4. **Test-Driven**: Add or improve tests before modifying implementation
5. **User-Centered**: Prioritize changes that improve user experience

## 3. Specific Refactoring Targets

Based on the Frontend Component Analysis, we've identified these specific refactoring targets:

### 3.1 Component Architecture Refactoring

**Current Issues**:
- Several oversized components (ClassEditor.tsx: 397 lines, FileUpload.tsx: 361 lines)
- Inconsistent component nesting and organization
