## 10. Conclusion

This Test Enhancement Plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for improving the test coverage and quality of the Gym Class Rotation Scheduler project. By addressing critical coverage gaps, standardizing testing approaches, and implementing automation, we will establish a robust testing framework that supports ongoing development and refactoring.

The phased implementation approach allows for prioritizing critical areas while gradually improving overall test coverage. The success criteria establish clear targets for measuring the effectiveness of the enhancement efforts.
