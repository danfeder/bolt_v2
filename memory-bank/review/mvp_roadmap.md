## 5. Critical Path and Dependencies

### 5.1 Critical Path

The critical path for MVP completion consists of:

1. **Dashboard Implementation** → **Testing and Refinement** → **Integration** → **Documentation/Deployment**

This path represents the longest sequence of dependent activities required to complete the MVP. Any delay in these components will directly impact the final delivery date.

### 5.2 Key Dependencies

| Dependency | Description | Risk Level |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| Dashboard API ← Dashboard UI | UI components depend on API endpoints being available | High |
| Constraint Config UI ← Constraint API | Configuration interface depends on backend API capabilities | Medium |
| Error Handling ← All Components | Standardized error handling must be implemented across all components | Medium |
| Integration Testing ← Feature Completion | Testing cannot begin until features are implemented | High |
| Deployment ← Testing | Deployment depends on successful testing completion | Medium |

### 5.3 Risk Mitigation

1. **Early API Development**: Begin API development before UI components to avoid blocking frontend work
2. **Parallel Development**: Implement independent components in parallel where possible
3. **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI/CD pipeline for early detection of integration issues
