# Backend Refactoring Plan

**Task ID**: P-03  
**Status**: Completed  
**Date**: March 2, 2025  
**Dependencies**: A-04 (Backend Component Analysis)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for refactoring the backend components of the Gym Class Rotation Scheduler project. Based on the Backend Component Analysis (Task A-04), this plan addresses identified technical debt, architectural weaknesses, and test coverage gaps. The refactoring aims to improve code quality, maintainability, and testability while preserving core functionality.

## 2. Refactoring Targets and Approach

### 2.1 High-Level Refactoring Goals

1. **Improve Architecture**: Introduce clear separation of concerns with proper layering
2. **Enhance Testability**: Increase test coverage and improve test design
3. **Reduce Complexity**: Simplify overcomplex components and reduce coupling
4. **Standardize Patterns**: Apply consistent design patterns across the codebase
5. **Improve Documentation**: Add comprehensive inline documentation

### 2.2 Refactoring Principles

The refactoring will adhere to the following principles:

1. **Incremental Changes**: Refactor in small, testable increments to minimize risk
2. **Test-First Approach**: Add or improve tests before modifying implementation
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain API compatibility where possible
4. **Continuous Integration**: Ensure all changes pass existing tests
5. **Clear Documentation**: Document architectural decisions and patterns

## 3. Specific Refactoring Targets

Based on the Backend Component Analysis, we've identified these specific refactoring targets:

### 3.1 UnifiedSolver Refactoring

**Current Issues**:
- Complex initialization with excessive configuration
- High coupling with specific constraint implementations
- Too many responsibilities in a single class

**Refactoring Plan**:

1. **Extract Configuration Handling**:
   - Create a dedicated `SolverConfiguration` class to encapsulate configuration
   - Implement validation and sensible defaults for configuration
   - Use the builder pattern for clearer initialization

2. **Implement Strategy Pattern for Solvers**:
   - Create a `SolverStrategy` interface
   - Implement concrete strategies for different solving approaches (OR-Tools, Genetic, Hybrid)
   - Allow dynamic strategy selection based on problem characteristics

3. **Extract Constraint Management**:
   - Enhance the existing `ConstraintManager` to be more independent
   - Implement a standard interface for all constraints
   - Create a constraint registry for dynamic constraint loading

4. **Improve Dependency Injection**:
   - Use constructor injection for dependencies
   - Reduce direct instantiation of dependencies
   - Prepare for future IoC container integration

### 3.2 API Layer Improvements

**Current Issues**:
- Zero test coverage for main API endpoints
- Business logic mixed with request handling
- Inconsistent response formats

**Refactoring Plan**:

1. **Introduce Service Layer**:

- Mixed domain and data transfer objects

**Refactoring Plan**:

1. **Create Core Domain Models**:
   - Define clear domain models with proper encapsulation
   - Separate domain logic from data structures
   - Implement validation in models

2. **Implement Data Transfer Objects**:
   - Create DTOs for API requests/responses
