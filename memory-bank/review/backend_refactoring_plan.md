   - **Progress Notes**:
     - March 2, 2025: Created `BaseRepository` and `AggregateRepository` interfaces
     - March 2, 2025: Implemented `ScheduleRepository` interface and `FileScheduleRepository` implementation
     - March 2, 2025: Created `RepositoryFactory` for dependency injection
     - March 2, 2025: Integrated repository pattern with service layer
   - **Output**: Clean separation between domain logic and data access

3. **Service Layer**: **Status**: [✓]
   - Implement application services
   - Create interfaces for external components
   - Support dependency injection
   - **Progress Notes**:
     - March 2, 2025: Created `BaseService` interface for common service functionality
     - March 2, 2025: Implemented `SchedulerService` with proper dependency injection
     - March 2, 2025: Created `ServiceFactory` for managing service dependencies
     - March 2, 2025: Integrated service layer with repositories and domain model
   - **Output**: Clean separation between API and domain logic

## 2.3 Testing Infrastructure

   - Implement common test fixtures
   - **Progress Notes**:
     - March 2, 2025: Created comprehensive test fixtures for all domain objects
     - March 2, 2025: Implemented generators for test data in different scenarios
     - March 2, 2025: Created assertion utilities specific to scheduler domain
     - March 2, 2025: Added end-to-end testing capabilities for API and service layers
   - **Output**: Robust testing infrastructure

2. **Integration Testing**: **Status**: [✓]
   - Create integration test framework
