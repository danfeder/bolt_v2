# Scheduler Build Plan

## Current State (Phase 1)
✓ Basic Time Slot Validity
  - Classes only on weekdays
  - Valid periods (1-8)
  - No overlapping classes
✓ Basic Assignment Rules
  - Each class scheduled exactly once
✓ Optimization
  - Minimize total schedule duration
  - Basic period distribution

## Phase 2: Conflict Periods and Teacher Unavailability
1. Conflict Period Constraints
   - [x] Basic conflict period avoidance
   - [ ] Required periods assignment
   - Test cases:
     * Single conflict period
     * Multiple conflict periods
     * Full day conflicts

2. Teacher Unavailability
   - [ ] Add teacher unavailability model
   - [ ] Implement unavailability constraints
   - [ ] Test with sample unavailability patterns

## Phase 3: Class Limit Constraints
1. Daily Limits
   - [ ] Maximum classes per day constraint
   - [ ] Add daily assignment tracking
   - [ ] Test various max classes scenarios

2. Weekly Limits
   - [ ] Maximum classes per week constraint
   - [ ] Minimum periods per week constraint
   - [ ] Add weekly tracking
   - [ ] Test min/max combinations

3. Consecutive Classes
   - [ ] Add consecutive classes tracking
   - [ ] Implement as hard/soft constraint based on settings
   - [ ] Test both constraint modes

## Phase 4: Period Preferences
1. Preferred Periods
   - [ ] Add preferred period weighting
   - [ ] Update objective function
   - [ ] Test preference satisfaction

2. Avoid Periods
   - [ ] Add period avoidance penalties
   - [ ] Balance with other preferences
   - [ ] Test avoidance behavior

## Phase 5: Advanced Optimization
1. Schedule Distribution
   - [ ] Even distribution across active weeks
   - [ ] Even distribution within weeks
   - [ ] Test distribution patterns

2. Multi-Objective Optimization
   - [ ] Weight balancing between objectives
   - [ ] Priority handling
   - [ ] Test complex scenarios

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests for Each Constraint
   - Input validation
   - Constraint satisfaction
   - Error handling

2. Integration Tests
   - Multiple constraint interaction
   - Full schedule generation
   - Error scenarios

3. Performance Testing
   - Small datasets (3-5 classes)
   - Medium datasets (10-15 classes)
   - Full datasets (30+ classes)

## Performance Optimization
1. Caching Implementation
   - Valid time slot caching
   - Daily/weekly count tracking
   - Date string caching

2. Solver Optimization
   - Class ordering by constraints
   - Variable reduction
   - Early constraint checking

## Validation and Error Handling
1. Schedule Verification
   - All constraint checks
   - Complete schedule validation
   - Clear error reporting

2. Progress Tracking
   - Solver progress monitoring
   - Constraint satisfaction status
   - Performance metrics

## Success Criteria for Each Phase
1. All constraints properly enforced
2. Performance within acceptable limits
3. Clear error messages for violations
4. Comprehensive test coverage
