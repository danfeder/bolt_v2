# Test Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document tracks improvements made to the testing framework for the scheduling system. The testing infrastructure has been enhanced to support both the traditional CP-SAT solver and the genetic algorithm optimization approach.

## Test Configuration Notes

### Running Tests

- Use `pytest -xvs tests/integration/test_scheduler.py` to run all integration tests
- Use `pytest -xvs tests/integration/test_scheduler.py::test_basic_schedule_generation` to run a specific test
- Add `--no-genetic` flag to disable genetic optimization for all tests

### Test Environment Variables

- `ENABLE_GENETIC_OPTIMIZATION=0` disables genetic algorithm
- `ENABLE_GRADE_GROUPING=0` disables grade grouping optimization
- `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` is automatically set by pytest to indicate test mode

### Model Compatibility

The current test framework supports both model versions:
- Classic object model with `id`/`name` attributes
- Newer model with `classId`/`name` attributes
- Different field access patterns (direct attributes vs nested attributes)
- Both dictionary and object representations of assignments
