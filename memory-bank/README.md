## Documentation Maintenance

To keep documentation manageable:

1. **Documentation should be updated** when:
   - New features are implemented
   - Project priorities change
   - Technical approaches are revised

2. **Outdated documents** should be:
   - Marked as historical/archived
   - Moved to the appropriate section
   - Referenced from current documents when relevant

3. **New documentation** should:
   - Follow the established structure
   - Clearly indicate its purpose and currency
   - Be added to this guide
