- [x] Basic Assignment Rules
  * Each class scheduled exactly once
- [x] Basic Optimization
  * Minimize total schedule duration
  * Basic period distribution
- [x] Conflict Period Avoidance
  * Pre-filtered during variable creation
  * Validation and testing
  * Logging and error reporting

## Phase 2: Required Periods and Teacher Unavailability 
### Development Version Progress
- [x] Required Periods Assignment
  * Model updates
  * Constraint implementation
  * Testing and validation
  * Error handling

### Completed
- [x] Teacher Unavailability

  * Constraint implementation
  * Integration testing
  * Validation checks

## Phase 3: Class Limit Constraints 
### Completed & Promoted to Stable
- [x] Daily Limits
  * Maximum classes per day constraint
  * Daily tracking implementation
  * Validation and testing
  * Debug panel integration
- [x] Weekly Limits
  * Maximum classes per week constraint
  * Pro-rated first week minimums
  * Weekly tracking system
  * Validation checks
- [x] Consecutive Classes

  * Updated documentation
  * Verified with large dataset
  * Confirmed constraint satisfaction

## Phase 4: Period Preferences 
### Completed & Verified
- [x] Preferred Periods
  * Added preference weighting system (1.0-2.5)
  * Integrated with objective function (1000 × weight)
- [x] Avoided Periods
  * Added negative preference weights (-1.0 to -2.5)
  * Integrated with objective function (-500 × weight)
- [x] Early Period Preference
  * Bonus for earlier periods (10 to 0)
  * Balanced full week distribution
  * Clear priority hierarchy
- [x] Priority System
  * Required periods (10000)
  * Early scheduling (5000)
  * Preferred periods (1000 × weight)
  * Avoided periods (-500 × weight)
  * Earlier dates (10 to 0)
