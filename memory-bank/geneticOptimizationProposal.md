## Proposed Integration

### 1. Architecture Changes

#### New Components

```

#### Enhanced Configuration
```python
class GeneticAlgorithmConfig:
    POPULATION_SIZE = 100
    ELITE_SIZE = 10
    MUTATION_RATE = 0.1
    CROSSOVER_RATE = 0.8
    ADAPTATION_INTERVAL = 50  # Generations between parameter adjustments
    
class SolverConfig:
    # Existing configuration
    ENABLE_METRICS = True
    ENABLE_SOLUTION_COMPARISON = True
    ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_DISTRIBUTION = True
    
    # New genetic algorithm configuration
    ENABLE_GENETIC_OPTIMIZATION = False  # Feature flag
    GENETIC_CONFIG = GeneticAlgorithmConfig()
```

### 2. Implementation Details

#### Chromosome Design
```python
class ScheduleChromosome:
    def __init__(self):
        self.assignments = []  # List of class assignments
        self.fitness = 0.0
        
    def encode(self, schedule):
        # Convert schedule to genetic representation
        # Each gene represents a class-time-instructor assignment
        
    def decode(self):
        # Convert genetic representation back to schedule
        
    def validate(self):
        # Check against hard constraints
        # Returns boolean indicating validity
```

#### Adaptive-Elitist Mechanisms

1. **Elitism**
   - Preserve best solutions across generations
   - Maintain diversity while ensuring progress
   - Configurable elite size

```python
class PopulationManager:
    def select_elite(self, population, elite_size):
        # Sort by fitness and select top performers
        return sorted(population, key=lambda x: x.fitness)[-elite_size:]
        
    def update_population(self, population, offspring):
        # Preserve elite members
        elite = self.select_elite(population, self.config.ELITE_SIZE)
        # Replace worst performers with offspring
        population[:-len(elite)] = offspring
        population[-len(elite):] = elite
```

2. **Adaptive Parameters**
   - Dynamic mutation rate based on population diversity
   - Adaptive crossover probability
   - Self-tuning mechanism for genetic operators

```python
class AdaptiveController:
    def adjust_mutation_rate(self, population_diversity):
        # Increase mutation when diversity is low
        if population_diversity < DIVERSITY_THRESHOLD:
            return min(MAX_MUTATION_RATE, 
                      self.current_mutation_rate * 1.5)
        return BASE_MUTATION_RATE
        
    def adjust_parameters(self, population_metrics):
        # Adjust genetic parameters based on performance
        self.mutation_rate = self.adjust_mutation_rate(
            population_metrics.diversity)
        self.crossover_rate = self.adjust_crossover_rate(
            population_metrics.convergence_rate)
```

### 3. Integration with Existing System

#### UnifiedSolver Enhancement
```python
class UnifiedSolver:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.genetic_optimizer = (
            GeneticOptimizer(config.GENETIC_CONFIG)
            if config.ENABLE_GENETIC_OPTIMIZATION
            else None
        )
    
    def create_schedule(self, request):
        if self.config.ENABLE_GENETIC_OPTIMIZATION:
            return self.create_schedule_genetic(request)
        return self.create_schedule_standard(request)
        
    def create_schedule_genetic(self, request):
        initial_population = self.generate_initial_population(request)
        optimizer = self.genetic_optimizer
        
        for generation in range(MAX_GENERATIONS):
            optimizer.evolve_population(initial_population)
            if optimizer.convergence_reached():
                break
                
        best_solution = optimizer.get_best_solution()
        return self.convert_to_schedule(best_solution)
```
