## Recent Cleanup ‚úÖ
- [x] Removed legacy scheduler.py
  * All functionality migrated to modular structure:
    - Base solver implementation in solvers/base.py
    - Stable solver in solvers/stable.py
    - Development solver in solvers/dev.py
    - Distribution tracking in objectives/distribution.py
    - Validation in constraints/
    - Helpers in utils/
