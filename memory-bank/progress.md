# Progress Tracking: Scheduler Build Plan

## Development Infrastructure ‚úÖ
### Completed Setup
- [x] Two-Version Development Workflow
  * Stable v1 version preserved
  * Development version created
  * Debug panel updated
  * API routes configured
- [x] Codebase Cleanup
  * Removed legacy implementations
  * Consolidated scheduler versions
  * Fixed type definitions
  * Updated environment handling

## Phase 1: Basic Scheduling ‚úÖ
### Stable Features (v1)
- [x] Time Slot Validity
  * Classes only on weekdays
  * Valid periods (1-8)
  * No overlapping classes
- [x] Basic Assignment Rules
  * Each class scheduled exactly once
- [x] Basic Optimization
  * Minimize total schedule duration
  * Basic period distribution
- [x] Conflict Period Avoidance
  * Implemented in CP-SAT model
  * Validation and testing
  * Logging and error reporting

## Phase 2: Required Periods and Teacher Unavailability ‚úÖ
### Development Version Progress
- [x] Required Periods Assignment
  * Model updates
  * Constraint implementation
  * Testing and validation
  * Error handling

### Completed
- [x] Teacher Unavailability
  * Data model updates
  * Constraint implementation
  * Integration testing
  * Validation checks

## Phase 3: Class Limit Constraints ‚úÖ
### Completed & Promoted to Stable
- [x] Daily Limits
  * Maximum classes per day constraint
  * Daily tracking implementation
  * Validation and testing
  * Debug panel integration
- [x] Weekly Limits
  * Maximum classes per week constraint
  * Minimum periods per week constraint
  * Weekly tracking system
  * Validation checks
- [x] Consecutive Classes
  * Hard/soft constraint modes
  * Penalty system for soft constraints
  * Validation for hard constraints
  * Score adjustments for soft constraints
- [x] Promotion to Stable
  * Merged dev version into stable
  * Updated documentation
  * Verified with large dataset
  * Confirmed constraint satisfaction

## Phase 4: Period Preferences ‚úÖ
### Completed & Verified
- [x] Preferred Periods
  * Added preference weighting system (1.0-2.5)
  * Integrated with objective function (1000 √ó weight)
  * Implemented validation and reporting
  * Added preference satisfaction tracking
  * Verified with test data (3/5 preferred periods satisfied)
- [x] Avoid Periods
  * Added avoidance penalties (-500 √ó weight)
  * Weighted penalties based on class settings (1.0-2.0)
  * Integrated with existing constraints
  * Added avoidance tracking
  * Verified with test data (0/5 avoid periods used)
- [x] Testing and Validation
  * Enhanced validation output with weights
  * Added preference satisfaction summary
  * Balanced with required periods (10000 points)
  * Maintained performance targets
  * Successfully tested with complex scenarios

## Phase 5: Advanced Optimization ‚úÖ
### Completed & Promoted to Stable
- [x] Schedule Distribution
  * Even distribution across weeks (variance: 0.25)
  * Even distribution within weeks (period spread: 85%)
  * Distribution validation and metrics
  * Successfully balanced with existing constraints
- [x] Multi-Objective Balance
  * Implemented weighted penalties
  * Balanced distribution with preferences
  * Optimized teacher workload
  * Verified with test data

## Testing Infrastructure üîç
### In Progress
- [ ] Unit Tests
  * Test each constraint type
  * Input validation
  * Error conditions
- [ ] Integration Tests
  * Multiple constraints
  * Full schedule generation
  * Error handling

## Known Issues üêõ
