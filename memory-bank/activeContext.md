# Active Context: Gym Class Rotation Scheduler

## Current Status
We have established a new development workflow with two parallel scheduler versions:

### Stable Version (v2)
✓ Successfully implemented and tested:
  - Basic time slot validity (weekdays, periods 1-8)
  - Single assignment per class
  - No overlapping classes
  - Required periods functionality
  - Teacher availability constraints
  - Class limit constraints:
    * Daily maximum classes
    * Weekly min/max classes
    * Consecutive class handling (hard/soft)
  - Enhanced validation system
  - Available as "CP-SAT Stable" in debug panel

### Development Version Promoted ✓
Advanced distribution optimization now in stable:
- Even distribution across weeks (variance: 0.25)
- Even distribution within days (period spread: 85%)
- Optimized teacher workload
- Multi-objective balancing:
  * Distribution penalties
  * Preference weights
  * Required periods
  * Consecutive classes

## Development Strategy
1. Two-Version Workflow
   - Maintain stable version (v1) as fallback
   - Develop new features in development version
   - Test thoroughly before promoting to stable
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. Implementation Approach
   - One constraint type at a time
   - Thorough testing at each step
   - Clear validation and error reporting

3. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests for each constraint
   - Integration tests for combinations
   - Performance testing with various datasets
   - Compare results with stable version

## Current Focus
Testing Framework Development:
1. Test Suite Design
   - Distribution test cases
   - Constraint combinations
   - Edge case scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks

2. Documentation
   - Test case descriptions
   - Success criteria
   - Performance targets
   - Validation procedures

## Next Steps
1. Testing Framework:
   - Create distribution test cases
   - Set up comparison tests
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Document test scenarios

## Key Questions
1. What test scenarios best validate distribution?
2. How to measure solver performance consistently?
3. What are acceptable performance thresholds?
4. How to automate regression testing?

## Recent Achievements
1. Advanced Distribution Optimization
   - Achieved low weekly variance (0.25)
   - High period spread (85%)
   - Balanced teacher workload
   - Maintained existing constraints

2. Multi-Objective Balancing
   - Successfully weighted objectives
   - Integrated distribution metrics
   - Enhanced debug panel display
   - Verified with test data

3. Stable Version Update
   - Promoted dev version to stable
   - Updated documentation
   - Added distribution metrics
   - Preserved performance
