# Active Context: Gym Class Rotation Scheduler

## Current Status
We have established a new development workflow with two parallel scheduler versions:

### Stable Version (v2)
✓ Successfully implemented and tested:
  - Basic time slot validity (weekdays, periods 1-8)
  - Single assignment per class
  - No overlapping classes
  - Required periods functionality
  - Teacher availability constraints
  - Class limit constraints:
    * Daily maximum classes
    * Weekly min/max classes
    * Consecutive class handling (hard/soft)
  - Enhanced validation system
  - Available as "CP-SAT Stable" in debug panel

### Development Version Focus
Working on solution quality improvements:
- Exploring alternative search strategies
- Fine-tuning objective weights
- Enhancing distribution metrics
- Improving early scheduling behavior
- Testing different solver parameters

### Recent Optimizations ✓
1. Variable Creation Optimization
   - Only create variables for non-conflicting periods
   - Significantly reduced search space
   - Improved solver performance
   - Removed redundant conflict constraints

2. Partial Week Handling
   - Pro-rated minimum periods for first week
   - Early scheduling incentives for last week
   - Balanced distribution for full weeks
   - Improved schedule compactness

3. Priority Weighting System
   - Required periods: 10000 (highest)
   - Early scheduling in last week: 5000 (high)
   - Preferred periods: 1000 × preference weight
   - Avoided periods: -500 × avoidance weight
   - Earlier dates: 10 to 0 (lowest)

## Development Strategy
1. Solution Quality Focus
   - Experiment with search heuristics
   - Test different objective balances
   - Analyze solution patterns
   - Compare with stable version

2. Implementation Approach
   - Iterative improvements in dev solver
   - A/B testing of changes
   - Quality metrics tracking
   - Comprehensive logging

3. Testing Strategy
   - Compare solution quality metrics
   - Validate improvements
   - Track solver performance
   - Document successful patterns

## Current Focus
1. Solution Quality
   - Test alternative search strategies
   - Adjust objective weights
   - Improve distribution balance
   - Enhance early scheduling

2. Development Version
   - Experiment with solver parameters
   - Try different search heuristics
   - Test objective variations
   - Document improvements

## Next Steps
1. Development Solver:
   - Implement new search strategies
   - Test objective weight adjustments
   - Try different solver parameters
   - Compare solution quality

## Key Questions
1. Which search strategies yield best results?
2. How to better balance competing objectives?
3. What metrics best measure solution quality?
4. Which solver parameters most affect quality?
